# Pilgrim archetype:
Those that fit the Pilgrim archetype tend to become wary and uncertain of their path when confronted with loss. Rather than traveling their path alone, they seek out supportive relationships in their journey for answers. They do not seek a quick fix, but a companion to help them sort through the aftermath that loss leaves in its wake.

# Villager
The Villager archetype is characterized by their need to understand the future before being able to move towards it. Villagers find the most comfort in facts, often reading a great deal or taking classes after a loss. They fear being ignorant and seek to minimize the pain of loss in the future through truth. They seek knowledge to sift through the noise so they can feel secure moving forward.

# Voyager
Voyagers allow the pain of grief to permeate them more than the other archetypes. These individuals believe that the pain of grief will eventually transform them and make them stronger. This makes them more willing to embrace the grief, but less likely to follow traditional models of processing grief. Voyagers respond best to diving deep into the emotional process and do not respond well to bright siding methods.
