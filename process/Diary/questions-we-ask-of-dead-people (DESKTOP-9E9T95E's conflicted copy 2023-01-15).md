A couple years after my Father died, I woke up one night and He was there standing in my bedroom, just looking at me. I said, Daddy, You died, why are You here. He said, I know, I just came back to check and see if you're doing ok. I said yeah, I'm doing alright, then, I Really Woke Up. It was a dream, but so Very Very Real. I had to get up and walk thru my house looking around. It really took a while to be able to go back to sleep. That was about fifteen years ago and it's never happened again.

I would like to ask Him, Did You really come back to check on me, or was it just a dream from my thoughts.?

I've never told but maybe two of my family about my dream, now writing this I realize I'm telling the world, and writing this has made tears from my eyes just thinking about missing my Dad.

<br>

“What were you trying to say before you died?”

<br>

“Dad, are you angry with me for throwing away all your hoarded ‘treasures’?”
<br>
“Why didn’t you tell the truth?” 
<br>

“Did I do the right thing?” 
<br>
“Is heaven real?” 
<br>
“Why did you have to go? I wasn’t ready for this,”
<br>
“How do I prepare for the other side?” 
<br>
“Have I made you proud?” 
<br>
“What about me is like you?”
<br>
“Time has softened me. Did it soften you?” 
<br>
“What was your deepest fear? Your proudest accomplishment? Your favorite pizza joint?” 
<br>
“Is the afterlife all that you expected and imagined?”
<br>
“Where were you going dad?” 
<br>
“Have I made you proud?”
<br>
Why did you keep my biological father a secret from me? Did my dad who raised me know? Did my biological father know?”
<br>
Should I do this?
<br>
“Can you send me Saturday’s winning lottery numbers, please?” 
<br>
“Dad, when you were in the coma could you hear me?”
<br>
“Should I stay or should I go?” She later messaged me to say after reading my question she started smelling roses, her mother’s favorite flower. “I will take it as a sign she is answering my question,” the woman concluded.
<br>
‘What if took this path?’ Which way?
<br>
‘How could I help him?’
<br>
‘What if I moved in?’
<br>
‘What can I do to improve communication between us?’
<br>
‘How am I doing with this?’ 
<br>
‘What if I tried this?’
<br>
‘How best to tackle this obstacle?’
<br>
‘What effect would it have on my workload if I took this on?’
<br>
‘How would this affect my children?’
<br>
‘What if we tried this…?’
<br>
‘Please show me an image of myself at present.’
<br>
‘How can I change my reaction to this?’
<br>
‘Why do I feel this way?’
<br>
‘Please give me a guiding principle for the coming year of my life.’
<br>
‘What do I need to know now?’
<br>
Talk to me
<br>
Why did this happen to us/me
<br>
Why didn’t I do something sooner?
<br>
Why did God let something like this happen?
<br>
How can I start to feel better?
<br>
How would s/he want me to move on?
<br>
How do I find the positive in all of this?
<br>
Are you angry with me?
<br>
Are you happy?
<br>
What are you doing?
<br>
Why don’t I feel better yet?
<br>
Mom, I feel ashamed that I laugh
