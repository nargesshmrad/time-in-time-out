Being synchronized with other individuals is defined by doing the same thing, at the same time and at the same place as others.
1. Being synchronized1,2 with other individuals is characterized by three components. Firstly, the temporal part of synchronization, called temporal synchrony, is defined as switching actions at the same time.The actions can be identical or different â€“ the important feature is the timing.

2. The behavioural part of synchronization, called activity synchrony, behavioural matching or allelomimicry, is defined as exhibiting the same behaviour at the same time.

3. Thirdly, the local aspect of synchronization, called local synchrony, is defined as being at the same place at the same time.

These three components are often observed together and cited as the general phenomenon of behavioural synchronization in a broad sense, as suggested by Louwerse, Dale, Bard, and Jeuniaux (2012). When considering non-conscious synchronization.
