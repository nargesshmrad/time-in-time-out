Types and World:
1.	Synchronization is a moment of truly sensing connectedness to somebody. Based on my field research and interviews, I got to be interested with the way my interviewees symbolized their feeling of synchronization with an intimate person. Most of them symbolize it to trees and their roots. After reading about the synchronization between trees, I learned about the synchronization of two chaotic mechanism, exactly like humans. Then, this questions popped up in my mind: how can we help two chaotic systems be synchronized to connect them emotionally and remind them they are not alone?

2.	Synchronization is a moment of truly sensing connectedness to somebody. Based on my field research and interviews, I became interested to show our feeling when we are synchronized with a person who we love. As my interviewees told, in this moment, you have no sense of time, and you only care about who you love. So, I became interested to create a similar feeling for somebody who feel exhausted of the world. To help them disappear everybody else in this world, stop the time, and only see who they love. This love can be imaginary.
(Choosing to be synchronized by just seeing the person, or being accidentally synchronized with(biologically))

World: A world in which people can make others disappear and stop the time to have a quiet closeness with sb. They can just look at the world with who they love and neglect the real world.

Contract: Characters are magicians. For them, time is controllable. People can be vanished. They can separate themselves from the ground.





3.	Synchronization is a moment of truly sensing connectedness to somebody. Based on my field research and interviews, I got to be interested in the connection between synchronization moment and nostalgia. How can we create a pattern of our synchronization with our loved one, and show it whenever the same synchronization happens to create a sense of nostalgia? How can we archive every synchronization moments that we have had with those we love?
(biological pattern of synchronization: Heartbeat, temperature,â€¦)



World: What if we could see our specific memories as patterns? In the world of fireflies, each time they are feeling something special with the one they love, they will light on and their light will never die, the pattern of light in their moment will be there for always. They can see their moment, compare it with other moments and somehow see the similar feelings and similar patterns between different experiences.
The world of fireflies is a world of vivid memories. In this world, when each firefly fall in love, it starts a synchronized light with its loved one. This moment will be archived in the air, demonstrated whenever they pass. If they have a similar synchronize feeling compared to years ago, they can see it and recall what happened before in another location and time. Fireflies live in a

4.	Synchronization is a moment of truly sensing connectedness to somebody. It can enhance our social relationship with someone to accomplish a social goal. After my interviews, I got to learn about the methods that people use to control this synchrony. The patterns that they create. Besides, I got to know about accidental synchrony too. These ideas made me think about playing a game in which two people can achieve best result with synchrony. This can be an imitation game or mirror game.

5.	Synchronization is a moment of truly sensing connectedness to somebody. It can enhance our social relationship with someone to accomplish a social goal. After my interviews, I got to learn about the patterns of synchrony in sex and the simultaneous climax. The patterns that they create. Besides, I got to know about accidental synchrony too. These ideas made me think about playing a game in which two people can achieve best result with synchrony and reaching a climax.

6.	Synchronization is a moment of truly sensing connectedness to somebody. Based on my field research and interviews, I became interested to show our feeling when we are synchronized with persons we love. In most of the interviews, people symbolized their moment of synchronization to trees. This initially created a point in my head about symbolizing humans as trees and showing our connection to the people around with our roots. When we have more synchronization, these roots thighs up the most. In this regards, we can even depict our relationship to the one we do not have anymore. The roots are still there, but the shapes are different.
(Biologic)

World:In this world all the trees are connected to their beloved one with roots. Their connection to the one they have lost is ashes through their veins. They show different patterns of closeness to their close friends. In this world, they can thigh up the relations or they can simply remove them and cut them.

7.	Synchronization is a moment of truly sensing connectedness to somebody. Based on my field research and interviews, I got to know about the moments of synchronization in which people guess what the other person wants to say or say the same sentence at the same time. So, I became interested to work on this type of synchronization based on guessing words and creating telepathy to send a message between people.
