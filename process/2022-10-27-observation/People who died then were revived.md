I was 15, had been through about 3-4 months of chemotherapy. I'd had a nosebleed on and off throughout the day and then after I went to bed it just kept on going. I couldn't sleep, just had to keep lying there, mopping my nose and sneezing out these rubbery little bloodclots. At about 2am I started to feel sick so I reached for the container (I always had one by my bed because the meds I was on gave me really bad morning sickness) and threw up. It was a thick, dark red.
After that I only remember what happened in short bursts. I think my mum had got up to go the bathroom and I managed to hit the wall loud enough for her to hear, she came in and there was blood everywhere, coming out my nose and mouth, all over the bed and on the walls. Real horror show. Then I remember a paramedic being there, trying to help me out of the bed. I must've collapsed against the wall after that because next time I came round I was strapped to a stretcher and they were taking me downstairs.
Then I was in the hospital, surrounded by about 6 doctors with these huge lights pointed right at me. It was to try and keep me warm because I'd lost so much blood. I could feel myself sweating but I was still cold, it was a weird feeling.
One of the doctors cauterized my nose and I definitely felt that, it hurt like a motherfucker even compared to my insides tearing themselves apart with sepsis and C. Difficile. The doctor who did it was so nervous that he pushed the white-hot material they use for cauterization right through my septum, I still have the hole today.
The worst part of it all, looking back, is how peaceful it can seem. When I started vomiting blood, I went into shock. Hitting the wall to get my mums attention was a subconscious thing, the rest of me just... stopped caring. When the doctors were trying to save my life, I just wanted to black out again. I didn't want the lights to hurt my eyes and the doctors to hurt the rest of me any more, the unconsciousness seemed easier. And that's how it felt when I was in the ICU for a few weeks after that, doped up on ketamine and slipping in and out of life. Being asleep was easy, being awake meant more pain and less dignity.
So if you want to know what it's like to be that close to death, it's tempting. It's like wanting to hit the snooze button on your alarm at 7am. And maybe you do hit it once or twice but then you remember that you have work or school and that sleep can wait because you've still got shit to do.

I got sepsis from tools used over at a dentist.
I went to the dentist feeling fine. Happy that I finally got the work done that I needed. I went out shopping with my mom and had a lovely time.
Around 7PM I started feeling dizzy. I had just flown in from Japan, so I assumed it was jetlag and fell asleep.
I woke up in the middle of the night with a 42 celcius fever and I couldn't lift my head high enough to puke on the floor, so I puked all over myself, the bed and my lovely concerned dog.
I tried to yell out to my mother but I didn't even have the strength to do that. Luckily, the sounds of me vomiting was enough to wake her up.
I vomited so much I was vomiting the lining of my stomach as I had no more food left in me. My mother carried me to the car and drove me to the emergency room.
Once arrived at the hospital I was put on the most uncomfortable bed ever and drifted off. I couldn't stay awake.
That's when I saw nurses and doctors around me injecting me with things and shouting. I remember thinking that it must be serious if a doctor was shouting, as they usually don't show panic.
I was lucid enough to laugh internally thinking "Wow.. I must be really sick if I don't even freak out over all of these injections"
and then it happened, I saw my mom crying and I thought "Holy shit.. this must be for real."
and as soon as I thought that, I fell asleep. I say asleep, but I died. for exactly 2 minutes. It really feels like falling asleep, but.. for me it was beyond peaceful.
It felt like you didn't really have to worry about anything anymore and obviously in my case - I didn't feel sick anymore.
As someone that was once suicidal - this was actually a horribly dangerous feeling as for the first time I got confirmation that dying wasn't all that scary.
I woke up seven days later in the hospital. It took me another seven to start eating and they told me that I more than likely got sepsis from infected tools at the dentist.
The scariest part was after that happened - I no longer feared dying. So I consciously try to pull myself out of a depression whenever I feel it coming.
But - for whoever is scared that their loved one felt pain in death, I can honestly say - it's a very peaceful feeling.

I was 16 years old and encountered tachycardia for the first time. Went to the ER with my mom, not really thinking it was a big deal (hardly any symptoms aside from high heart rate). I didn't realize how intense the situation was until two cardiologists and several nurses rushed me to what looked like an operating room of sorts.
Again, I didn't really know the full extent of what was happening, I felt pretty normal and never had a history of heart issues up until then. However, my mom worked in the medical field for several decades and I could see the utter fear and concern on her face.
Fast forward to the doctors trying to slow my heart down but couldn't. Last resort is some drug that essentially stops your heart and resets it at a normal beat. Right as they're giving me the drug, they warn me I might feel a heavy weight on my chest.
What a fucking understatement. Felt like someone was bit by bit, squeezing all the air and life out of me. Eventually the room went black and a feeling of peace came over me, like I was going to sleep. I didn't see anything good or bad, just emptiness.
When I awoke, I assumed only a few seconds had passed. Instead, the drug caused my heart to stop for 10 minutes or so and the doctors were trying to revive me, assuming I was dead given the flat line.
I'm 27 now and two years ago I had a second episode happen. Luckily, when they gave me the drug I didn't pass out, yet I was forcing myself to stay awake, I didn't want to die again.
EDIT: Not sure if anyone wants to see it but I have a photo from when I got the ablation surgery done. It's the wires running into my heart that they used to zap the hell out of the bad cells causing my heart issue.

I had bacterial meningitis, and died on the helicopter ride to a better hospital. After I died I was in a coma (medically induced) for a while, because I was basically insane when they brought me back, and able to move again. But I remember zero of that. None. All I remember is the dream or Out of Body Experience I had.
I don't know when it started. Or if it happened while I was dead for those few moments, or later on. But the last thing I remembered was vomiting blood on my mom, then passing out. It seems today like it was an immediate transition into my dream. And the dream itself only lasted a few moments (maybe 15 minutes total, it seemed.) And I awoke 2 weeks later, with my mind right again.
But during the dream I was a younger child. In my grandfather's truck, and we were driving to his office. A route I was very familiar with, even as a 5-7 year old (which is who I was, in my dream.) We were listening to the radio. And my grandpa's favorite talk show was on. Big D, and Bubba. Holy shit, I know what you're thinking "What a Redneck show..." It was actually hilarious. They were for whatever reason talking about a rude fat lady they met somewhere, yadda yadda. But the joke at the end stuck with me for some reason. "There are three kinds of fat, Husky, Pretty Big, and OH MY GOD IT'S COMIN' THIS WAY". 5ish year old me thought that was pretty great.
Right after that joke we pulled up to my grandpa's office. I was too short to see all of it, but the way I always knew we had arrived was, it was next door to the Sheriff's office. And I could see the Sheriff's star logo on his big window. I heard my grandpa's voice. "Time to get out Bowie" (Bowie being my nickname, for him.)
I realized I had not once looked over from my window, or the front window at my grandpa. So I finally looked over, and to my surprise...and almost horror, it wasn't him. This will sound insane, and stupid. But it was a man who had all the trademarks of an older man. He was frail, gray, hunched over, and he just had that "grandfatherly" vibe. He was smiling at me. But that is when I noticed the weirdest part, he had not a wrinkle on his face. His face was young. And quite honestly it looked a lot like me (well, me today. Not me at 5.) I had never seen this man, ever.
But he kept smiling and said again, "Time to get out." To which, I very confusedly turned to my door and opened it to exit the truck. As I opened the door, I was met with blinding light, then the light faded. It was like a camera flash on steroids. Once it faded, I was laying in my hospital bed. And oddly enough...my dad was complaining about a fat, rude nurse that was not taking care of some stuff for them (bringing him a blanket or something.)
My first words upon coming out of that coma/dream, I shit you not were "Dad....Dad...There are three kinds of fat, Husky, Pretty Big, and OH MY GOD IT'S COMIN' THIS WAY."
To which my family sort of sat in shock and awe over, then all started laughing. The doctor walked in and said "Oh..OH HE'S UP!" and ran off to go get nurses.
Ok, here's the real kicker.
Years after this. Years after my long, shitty, painful road to recovery, I found a box of old pictures in my grandparent's house. My grandma saw me with it and started taking photos out to show me.
"And here is you Great Grandpa, my dad, in California right before leaving for Pearl Harbor."
I met my great grabsfather, yes. He lived through World War II, and I met him as a 2 year old. My only memory of him was as an old, dying man. I had never seen "Young" him.
We look almost exactly alike. I'm convinced it was him in the truck. I think he was the one that got me through whatever loop I was stuck in.

When I was 14 and at a party, I drank way too fucking much. (I was sort of an alcoholic even at that age, due to easy access to alcohol at the time. Also a family full of alcoholics who didn't give a fuck.)
Woke up on the bathroom floor vomiting my guts out, in and out of consciousness. I could faintly hear my brother in the background, calling for an ambulance.
Woke up in a hospital bed where the doctor said I had been dead for 2 minutes, but they managed to revive me. My BAC was 0.56.
In my experience, being dead was like being asleep. Absolutely no difference. No flashbacks, no afterlife that I could recall... It was exactly like sleeping. Very peaceful.
As if that wasn't bad enough, I continued to drink heavily for YEARS after that incident because I hadn't learned my fucking lesson apparently. I eventually sought out help after another scare, but that's a story for another day.
18 months sober.

This will probably get buried but seems worthwhile enough to post. I've died twice, medically speaking. The first time was due to a motorcycle accident; I passed out while cruising along at about 50mph (they still have no concrete idea why) and I was thrown into a light pole. I haven't told my family that I was dead when EMS carted me to the hospital. Seems like it'd just put them through more stress at this point. Anyway, I only have two clear memories of that event. The first is being upside down and wondering idly why the opposite road was passing by inverted. The second is hitting the pole and stopping. It hurt, a lot. I cannot accurately describe how badly that hurt but suffice it to say I'm a person with a high pain tolerance to begin with and if I had been in my right state of mind I would have wept like a child. I just remember being on the pavement and things slowly going black and quiet, which honestly was a relief because it made the pain feel more distant instead of the crushing immediacy it had before. The only reason I didn't fall asleep was a bizarre moment where I heard someone yelling "Ranger up you candy fuck! Come on man, get up. Get up. GET UP!" and then someone slapping my helmet (which was basically smushed really hard onto my head; the faceplate was bent up into my face and a good chunk was more or less shaved off). When I opened my eyes I saw my brother squatting on the pavement next me to. This was odd because my brother has been dead from an OD for several years. I couldn't really gather the presence of mind to speak so I just looked at him. The only other thing I remember is him glancing at his watch and saying something like "They'll be here soon" and then walking away...that and the ambulance ride to intensive care where I was pronounced dead and then opened my eyes a few minutes later and told them I wanted a Big Mac. Pretty serious WTF moment. I wish I could give more detail but I honestly don't remember much of the incident and still have trouble with my memory as a result of the accident. Second incident I don't remember much of but I was stabbed and nearly bled out. I honestly just felt really tired and wasn't connecting the dots that I was dying. Luckily a cop happened upon me after I collapsed on the side of the road and called emergency services who then successfully revived me. I was apparently only gone for like 20-30 seconds with that one so it doesn't stick in my memory like the first incident. That was back when I was hip deep in shady people who dealt drugs etc. so I more or less brought it on myself.
Anyway, if anyone actually reads this I'll feel moderately better about taking the time to type it up.
EDIT: I may have had issues with the police in the past but that man saved my life by holding pressure until EMS showed up. I would be dead if he hadn't taken the initiative to jump out and jam his hands into my stab hole. Not all police are bad, kids. That man was a fucking hero.

I didn’t die, but came extremely close. When I was having my baby, I had a full abruption, meaning the placentia completely disconnected from the uterus, which causes an enormous hemorrhage of blood everywhere. The little fetal monitoring alarm started going crazy and the nurse hit the emergency button on the wall. All of a sudden, a recorded message of "code somethingerother" started on the loud speaker and I was surrounded by 20 or 30 doctors, nurses and anesthesiologists (University Hospital). They were all shouting out orders and stats and whatever the hell. Nobody would tell me what was going on though, other than I was going in for a c-section right the hell now.
I started screaming just out of fear and adrenaline and I remember my doctor grabbing both sides of my face and telling me "you cannot scream. You have to stop right now or you are going to die. Do you understand?"
So I was in the OR within a minute. But the strangest freaking moment of my life happened. Without wanting to, all my fear just disappeared in an instant and I had this amazing peace I have never felt before or since. I can't even describe how peaceful it was. I didn't see my life flash before me, but I did have a memory of a day about a year before where I was just playing in a field with my little boy. I hadn't thought about it before then, but now I kept seeing him, clear as day, laughing in the sun. It was the most vivid, intense memory I've ever had of anything. I was so at peace and that memory made me the weird, peaceful kind of happy, like my work was done. I knew I was about to die and I was totally fine with it.
It was a complete mind fuck when I woke up and leaned that my baby and I lived. Still a mind fuck, really. I feel like I always have that Final Destination effect, like something horrendous could happen any time.

About 5 years ago I had to get some pretty major surgery. I have had several over the years and this was going to be the last one.
I always get nervous about having surgery, but this time I knew something was going to go wrong. It sounds silly but I felt so strongly about it that I wrote a will and left it on my dresser just in case.
Anyway, things go wrong during the surgery and I start to bleed out. Things went even further south and then my heart stopped beating. I found out later that I was dead for several minutes.
Now I don't know if this was real or a hallucination or a mixture of the two.
I woke up in what looked like space but there wasn't any stars or light. I wasn't floating so to speak, I was just there. I wasn't hot/cold, hungry, tired, just a peaceful neutral kind of thing. I knew there was light and love somewhere nearby but I had no urge or need to go to it right away.
I remember thinking over my life, but it wasn't like a montage. More like I was idly flipping through a book and snippets stood out here and there.
I don't remember making a decision to stay or go back, I just woke up in the ICU two days later.
Whatever it was, it changed my thoughts on a few things. I am still afraid to die, but I'm not worried about what happens after that.

Showed up late but I'll still share my story. I didn't momentarily die but I got to the closest stage possible to death and stayed there for a few days, but talking to people that have, we found we shared similar experiences. When I was 15, I ended up developing septic shock and multiple organ failure (both kidneys, liver damage, collapsed lung, morbidly low heart rate and blood pressure, very high fever ~ 43 degrees Celsius and being fully unable to move throughout the duration of my stay in hospital) Before I was rushed to hospital I had very vivid hallucinations. The one I remember most clearly happened about an hour before the ambulance first arrived. This whole fiasco occurred during the winter so it got dark ridiculously early. I remember being asleep on my parents bed facing the wall furthest from the door. It was around 6pm and the lights were off, but for some reason the wall I was staring at was perfectly lit, enough to cast a shadow of anybody trying to enter the room. I saw the figure of man carrying a large bulky object standing at the doorway, he said in arabic( my family's Egyptian) "I know your father and mother" and then proceeded to place the object on the bed and sit down. I remembered this so clearly I asked my mam who the person was that visited me earlier. Dying itself was strangely peaceful. I could hear my heart rate decreasing on the monitor and time seemed to slow. It felt like floating on a warm sea, slowly being dragged by the tide, while you feel your body unraveling and the warmth of the water diffusing into you. It was probably the most peaceful thing I've experienced.

Years ago, I accidentally overdosed on heroin and was dead for apparently 30 seconds or so before waking up.
The shot was too big, but it didn't fully work right away (not like the movies, apparently). After I did it, I went back to my computer and started browsing Facebook for about 20 minutes.
Then, there was light. It reminded me of when I was tubing down the river with my family as a kid, and a current knocked me off my tube and sucked me under the river. All I could think of was to swim towards the light, since I had no idea which way was up. That's how I felt then, like the decision to live was simple...so I "swam" towards it. The first thing that I realized was that I was laying down on the floor in our house, with paramedics shining a light in my eyes (the joke is true). Then I thought: holy fuck, the cops are here, followed by: oh shit oh shit oh fuck fuck shit fuck I overdosed. And I felt very, very stupid and ashamed of putting my family through it, even accidentally.
The dying part did not hurt at all. At first I thought that was because I was really high when it happened. But no...I know now that I saw the line between life and death. It doesn't hurt to cross at all. It felt like being a kid, staying home sick from school with my dad, watching a random old movie on afternoon TV and...falling asleep. Just like that. Living is much, much harder than dying, by far.

Well, I'm late to the party, but when I was 12 I fell off a trampoline. Doesn't seem to dramatic, but there was a stake in the ground which went right through me, I lost a lot of blood and was dead for about 3 minutes before I was revived.
it was fucking comfy. I'm not sure if it was just my conscience beginning to reenter my body from the void, or if I slipped into some deeper part of my mind, but it truly did feel like I was becoming one with the universe; like some great force was drawing me too it basked in warmth and light. There's no pain when you're dead. Not even the small stuff. Little things like itches on your hands or small bruises on your legs or scrapes on your knees or the weight of the world, they're meaningless. You don't realize how painful life is to live until you haven't.
Anyways, It made me a lot less afraid of death as a whole, and a lot less anxious in my day to day life. I'm happy knowing that either after I'm dead or at least my last moments will be like that :)

I was 6 or 7 years old when I got infected by an aggressive strain of Salmonella. It was a painful, horrible experience... After 2 days with a very high fever and nonstop vomiting, my vision began to blur. Suddenly, everything went black. Like if someone had turned the lights off.
I could hear my parents and the doctor's voice, saying that I wasn't going to make it. I heard cries and something like a rattling, metallic sound.
And then I stopped hearing their voices.
After a while, it felt like I was in a dark room and my eyes had started to become used to the lack of light, because I started to see some shapes again. I could see the bed, the pillows ... And a girl, who was sitting in the bed, a few inches in front of me.
I heard her voice. She told me that she came from a faraway land, filled with wonders and amazing things, and that I belonged there.
Then I started shaking uncontrollably. I vomited again and woke up.
Everyone was convinced that I was going to die. My parents made a party for me, with a priest and paper skeletons that posed as guests. (I'm Mexican, and the Day of the Dead is my favorite holiday). But I was feeling better.
Within a week, I recovered, but the fever was so high that I lost my hair. A month later, it started growing back, but it wasn't curly anymore. From that day on, my hair turned straight.
Some time later, I told my parents about the strange dream that I had while I was sick, and they told me that, for a moment, I got completely limp and my skin started to get very pale. Even the doctor believed that I wasn't going to wake up... But suddenly, I started moving (and vomiting) again.
So... She told me that maybe, the girl I saw in my dreams was Death and somehow she allowed to let me live in exchange of my hair.
After that incident, I developed emetophobia (fear of vomit) and never watched the Neverending Story film again, as the girl that I saw looked a lot like the Empress from that movie.

Complete peace and serenity. Cannot be put into words. I felt something, maybe a being, guiding me with the purest and strongest love. I was about 10 at the time. Dying felt amazing, and I know this post sounds like so many other experiences, but it's true.
A few years ago I was put under for a biopsy. That feeling was truly odd, and felt a lot more like death should have. Lights out (except there is no blackness either), no concept of time, could have been out a minute or a year and wouldn't have known the difference.

<br>


My sixth grade teacher had a similar experience to your peace and serenity one. She was electrocuted as a child, died, and was revived.
She couldn't really explain how wonderful the feeling was, but she said for many years after that, every night she would think about it, and the memory of that warm, awesome feeling would help her fall asleep.
As she got older, the memory of that feeling slowly started fading away, until she couldn't feel it anymore at all.

<br>


Stupidly mixed alcohol, meds and summer heat (young and stupid). Smoked a "self made cigarette", the area used to be popular for shops where you go in and pick your flavors and what not... well, they also laced it with spice I think (very common in the area as well).
Anyway. I started feeling faint then eventually passed out. Was carried back to my apartment, husband at the time refused to call 911. I stopped breathing multiple times and according to friends and said husbands heart stopped.
I remember darkness except for where I was standing. It was as if I was standing on tiles that would light up only if I stepped on them. I saw something a little in the distance so walked towards it (in retrospect, kinda dumb to walk towards the light haha). At the end was my best friend who had died on a platform on these little tiles.
I hugged hug and screamed at him begging him to let me stay with him. He pushed me off slowly and told me it was ok, but I couldn't stay, I "have to go back, it's not time." I screamed for him as I felt myself being pulled away from him. He kept saying it will be ok, I had to fight because it wasn't time. The light around him grew drarker.
I woke up gasping for air and trying to call his name. My husband and best friend was standing over me, shaking me trying to get me to breathe and wake up fully.
Yeah. That's all.

“Time wrapped in on itself”
The Near-Death Experience Research Foundation (NDERF) collects stories from people who have seen the “other side.” One four-year-old girl was in the hospital with a high-grade fever that had caused hallucinations, vomiting, and fever, when she felt her toes reach the foot of the bed. She opened her eyes to see herself lying on a gurney before her non-body started to rise up, out of the building. “I began browsing through time,” she writes. “I later detailed things that occurred before I could even talk … As I kept ascending, I felt at peace. There were no questions or unknowns. Time wrapped in on itself. There was no past, present, or future as we see it here. Everything happened now and all at one time. I felt no fears or worries. I began drifting towards a beautiful light and I wanted to touch it. Suddenly there was a pop. It felt like I was attached to a cord when someone grabbed it and jerked me down.” Check out these other stories of the most miraculous medical recoveries.
