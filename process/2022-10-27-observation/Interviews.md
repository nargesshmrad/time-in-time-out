1.Setayesh:
time to me is like luminous particles suspended in the space that are moving slowly and we are immersed in it.
It smells like burnt wire
The most time I forget the time is when I have sex Or I spend time with someone I love

2.Ghazal:
It is colorless, but if I want to picture it with color, it is white
It has an indistinct smell, it is a combination of smells that keep changing, like a change from the smell of narcissus and jasmine to the smell of rained soil, then to the smell of orange peel, then to the smell of smoke or ash, and then to the smell of rice fields and... (like a parade of bitter, spicy, sweet, hot and cold smells) But again, if I want to say just one smell, it's like the smell of the sea.

Time takes me back to the memory of sunrise and sunset on the horizon line between the sky and the sea and the memory of the wind moving on the desert sands and they slide on each other and the sand dunes move slowly.
Again, if I want to say a memory, the memory of the moment of watching the meteor shower.

 Solid, liquid and gas or feeling close to the touch of things that are in our memory?

I forget time when I am deeply happy and sad

3.Nabat:
In my opinion, time is formless, an empty space, its color is grey, and it means all life and existence. Sometimes I forget the time when I am very happy and having fun. The sunlight,the movement of people, and my impression of the work I did, are what reminds me of time.


4.Soroush:
It is blue and sweet.

Every trips with my friends and family gives me a sense of time.
There is something like light, you know it is there, but you don't see it, or you just feel the heat

When I'm with the ones I love and when I'm working I forgot the time.
No matter how tired I am or I miss people

5.Sarah:
Blue
It smells like burnt wood
All the days I was with Mom, Dad and Eli
In my opinion, the material should be something soft and precious, like silk
