Establishing Shots
If a scene opens with a shot of the exterior of a house in the bright sunshine and the next scene opens with a full moon over a lake, the audience will get the idea that time in the story has transitioned from day to night even if no other cues are given. Likewise, if the viewers see people in 1950s style clothes walking down the sidewalk past a row of bright houses with 50s era cars parked out front, the audience will assume that this part of the story is taking place in the 1950s, even if the last scene took place in the Middle Ages.

Time-lapse
Time-lapse uses still shots of a fixed location over time; the stills are edited together to create this effect. 


Montage
A montage is a sequence of rapid shots used to quickly show the passage of time. 

Transitions
Cut
Jump Cut: Jean Luc Goddard helped pioneer their use in his 1960 masterpiece, “Breathless,”

Fades
Fade to Black
A fade to black is often used for a transition between two clips where a large amount of time passes in the story

Fade to White
The use of a fade to white is often reserved for transitioning to a character’s vision, thought or idea. 


 slow down time to highlight a complex or important step in the process.
