# no-time moment

# The world:
In this world, the time can be stopped and everything can be dissapeared except the two characters of the world. They try to build something together.
(We don't know if they can or not!But their desire is to do that)
<br> 

# Scope(???):
Characters can change their role in terms of climax. One might reach the climax by holding back and the other wi
# Contract(???)
If you think about time or synchronization, you become failed in synchronization.
<br> 

# Plot
the story starts with two person trying to reach a desire of synchrony in a subjective experience. However, this synchrony includes another synchrony: Synchronized climax. The plot is a loop of actions.

The different climaxes of feelings in the timeline in synchrony
Somehow their climax is the same too
Syncing climax with sb else
It is a cycle
what they experience through the plot: excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution.

# The climax of synchronization**
When people want to synchronize their climax together.
There is this world where you can stop time, make all the people vanish except your loved one(for example) and start a synchrony in which you have this ascending journey. What you desire is to have a climax in this synchrony. The highest desire is to synchronize this climax with this person's climax. The obstacle is thinking about all the things that I said! If you think about it, you lose it! You may even enter to this loop of not getting what you desire. You might even lie about your desire, or say that you had experienced this climax. There is this possiblity that you might experience shame, guilt, and anxiety because you have failed(for ex).
The interesting part is that you should not think about being simultaneous
The loop: learning about this person helps synchrony and synchrony helps you to learn about this person
It can be a practice
Something between being hurry or hold back
formulaic love

# What does this climax depend on?
 The other character, fantasy, what they can and can't feel,...
<br> 
 
 # How can I create changes in this subject?
What happens when two persons cannot talk, and they communicate their love in other ways, such as showing each other art, washing each other, and cooking for each other:
-maybe use this insight from sexual intimacy in another way of communication
-Maybe use it to show the communication of bodies with words, bodies with bodies
-maybe use this process metaphorically
-Project it on verbal communication
