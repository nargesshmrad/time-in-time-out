# Formation of memory:

The hippocampus is important in the organization and storage of new memories, especially those which are declarative memories (e.g., memories relating to facts and events).

This area is also responsible for making memories stronger by connecting sensations and emotions to these memories. For instance, the hippocampus has links with, and is approximate to the amygdala, a structure associated with emotions, especially fear.

The amygdala can work with the hippocampus to associate emotions to new memories to strengthen them. Essentially, if a memory has an element of fear attached to it, this makes it more likely to be remembered.

A famous case study from 1953 of a patient referred to as HM, had portions of his medial temporal lobes (including the hippocampus) removed. They were removed in an attempt to cure his epileptic seizures.

It was found that HMâ€™s cognitive functions remained intact, but after the procedure, he lost the ability to form new memories (also known as anterograde amnesia).

# Transfer of Long-Term Memories
Although the hippocampus is involved in memory, long-term memories are not thought to be stored within this structure.

Instead, the hippocampus is believed to be a transfer center for long-term memories. this means it can take in memory information, register it, then temporarily store it before it is then transferred to long-term memory stores.

Sleep is thought to play a critical role in the process of this. Information in the hippocampus circulates in this area whilst neurons start to encode this information through a process called long-term potentiation.

Long-term potentiation is a form of neural plasticity and is a vital mechanism in the storage of memory.

When this occurs in the hippocampus, the strongest of the circulating information then returns to the brain area where it originated from in order to turn the short-term memories into long-term memories.
