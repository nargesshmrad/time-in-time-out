1. writing a letter and throwing it away
2. let go of things that remind me of her
3. Delete texts. Delete pictures that were posted online. Delete emails. Anything that has the power to make me feel emotional about her should be removed. Even unfriending her on Facebook and delete her contact info from my phone, too.
4. writing down all the reasons the relationship ended
5. Learned how to be in the moment: mindfullness/ notice what's happening and engage with the present, there's no room in your mind for past memories and worries
6. Go for a walk, run or swim. Moving your body has the amazing effect of clearing your mind.
7. Distractions can be good, because they give your mind a break and help you remember that it is possible to think about things aside from your main worry.
Reading, watching movies and shows, and playing video games are all distractions that can be healing.
8. Change my environment
9. Meet new people
10. I think that most breakups are down to one thing - timing.
