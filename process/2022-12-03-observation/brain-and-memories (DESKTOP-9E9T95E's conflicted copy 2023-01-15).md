We are all changing, but we are used to the patterns that we have used.

In our brains, new neurons are born every single day

Depression can reuce the number of neurons in the brain. When someone in depressed, they cannot choose between regular and pleasuring things.


 There’s a reason we are who we are. Our emotions and thoughts do not happen to us, he argues. Rather, they are routine, predictable and rooted in the structure of our brains.


 Our default responses may be wired into us, but with time, effort and practice, you can change your brain to transform your life. “Neuroplasticity, the brain’s ability to reorganize, is the organ of change,” Davidson says. Thus, engaging regularly in positive activities over time will rewire the brain’s neural pathways and increase your positive feelings. He recommends the following exercises to develop your abilities in each of the six dimensions.

 To Boost Resilience and happier outlook: For five to 10 minutes at a time, four or five times a week, visualize someone you know who is suffering—an ill neighbor or a friend struggling in her marriage--and on each inhalation, imagine that you are taking on that suffering. On each exhalation, imagine the suffering is transformed into compassion, which will help ease the person's pain.

Fill your home and workspace with upbeat reminders of happy times, like photos of your family or vacations, and change the pictures every two weeks. Find opportunities to compliment others and make the effort to express gratitude often, by offering a warm thank you and writing down the things you appreciate in others and in your life.


To Better Regulate Emotional Reactions: To identify what produces a strong reaction in you, regularly make a list of the specific events or behaviors from the day or week that triggered your response. Then spend about 15 minutes thinking about these behaviors while breathing deeply until you feel comfortable and more relaxed.
