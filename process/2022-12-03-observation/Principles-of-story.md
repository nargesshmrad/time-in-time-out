
Using "you" instead of "I" or "She" in my story

To create an authentic experience, make sure you describe the realistic sights, sounds, smells, tastes, physical sensations, emotions, and thoughts only your hero experiences, leaving everything else out.

The flickering torchlight illuminates a key ring, a sword, and a coin pouch on a nearby table. Still catching your breath, you mull through your choices.

If you arm yourself with the sword, go to page 30

If you free the goblin with the keys, go to page 32

If you take the money and move on, go to page 97


Your story should begin with enough background, setting, action, and peripheral characters to allow your reader to both enjoy and understand it. Then, as you develop various scenarios, ask yourself:

What choices will advance the plotline? (Having your hero decide on a milkshake flavor or how much kibble to give the cat doesn’t matter. Yes, mundane choices are realistic because most options in life aren’t “life-or-death,” but don’t let your story stagnate with too many.)
Did I provide the choices at a good stopping point? (You hero probably won’t want to stop in the middle of a chase/fight/love scene. Keep it real.)
How do I make it fun for the reader? (Include variables. Lots of ‘em!)


Importance: Some decisions will be mundane, while others will be life-altering for your hero. Provide a good mix so the reader doesn’t get bored. 

Number: Not every real-life decision is limited to two choices, and your story should be the same. 

Clues: You could also provide clues, allowing your reader to guess what’s coming, but not every time — that would be unrealistic.

Plotline activity
Add to your spreadsheet as you go and make sure you cover everything. Along the top you might list important details, and along the side you might list either page numbers or a short phrase reminding you of what has occurred since the last decision point. Consider the following details:

Who has your hero met? Does your hero have any traveling companions? What is their relationship? (Friends, enemies, followers, pets, a second head?)
What is your hero’s inventory? Has your hero lost/gained an item? Is it needed to achieve the goal? (Food, money, weapons, climbing gear, a holy relic?)
What abilities or knowledge does your hero have? (Where is the hidden letter, who was in bed with whom, how to avoid a fight or pick a lock?)
Has your hero achieved the goal? (Reached a destination, killed the enemy, won over the love interest, rescued the prisoner, found that holy relic?)

Plotline endings
In a separate file, you’ll want to keep at least a basic list of how each plotline ends. Again, this is to keep your story’s entertainment value high. You wouldn’t want your hero to always find romance, always catch the bad guy, or always end up in the hospital. Boring! Think up a variety of different endings.

Let’s say you have five basic ending types: captured, killed, gets treasure, finds love, or goes home empty-handed. You might write five of each ending type for a total of 25 endings. (But it would behoove you to write less of the “gets killed” endings. Readers hate that!) Also, nothing is keeping you from combining your ending types. Maybe your hero gets the treasure but then gets captured!
