# Field Research:

Synchronization of people with people:

The activities they do for synchronization (verbal and non-verbal):
-Dance
-Sing
-Kissing
-Sleeping
-Playing musical instruments
-Talking
-Crying
-Laughing 
-Playing pantomime
-Parkour
-Walking
-Cycling
-Breathing
-Clapping
-Dubbing
-Cooking


What they do specifically to create synchronization in these activities:

-They try to get into their own feeling and let themselves flow in the moment.
-They observe each other's movement and try to mock

Musicians improvising and synchronizing together:

-Eyes moving on others' hands(following each other's hands)
-Pause for focus (and try to guess the pattern or the next movement) and continue to synchronize
-Tapping foot
-Smiling when they achieved synchronization
-The nod of the head
-Laugh
-Looking into the eye of other players
-Showing the same rhythm in the body
-They get into themselves and come out for synching again


Dancers improvising and synchronizing together:

-Trying to create an imaginary room and try to synchronize themselves in it
-Showing the expression of reconnecting to themselves at the moment
-Stop in between dances and then let it go (stop and go, tense and release)
-Creating a sound with their mouth like metronome
-Play with breathing, hold your breath and let it go
-What they say:
-They say the smaller(the movement) the better, we have more progress
-The decision is made for us by our bodies
-No matter what comes toward us, we are ready for it
-Do not predict it, do not fall into a pattern
 
Synchronization of people with objects:

People playing music and trying to synchronize themselves with the metronome:

-Faking their hands movement just to absorb the rhythm and start playing
-trying to get exactly like the metronome
-They are trying to feel comfortable in it before doing it
-They should not feel rushed
-They do not wait for it or anticipate it
-Be right along with it
-They try to have a good relationship with time and be in time with a -focused energy
-feet tapping
-The nod of the head
-Counting with the metronome

Synchronization of objects with objects:

-Metronomes, Pendulums, clocks


Synchronization of Animals:

-Fireflies messaging "mate with me" with their synchronized light
-Birds flock together and create a rhythm to avoid predators
-Fish swimming together and synchronizing to avoid predators
-Ambling Elephants
-Bees

What is needed for people to synchronize?

-To be attracted to each other
-Somehow it is good to be physically close, but it is not necessary
-Having same concerns and mutual feelings helps the synchronization
-Having relationship and mutual experiences helps the synchronization
-Mutual purpose 
-Having the tendency to synchronize
