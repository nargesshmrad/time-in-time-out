# Fireflies in Us
Life is full of precious moments of connectivity with our loved ones that we might forget. What if we could create a different type of language to freeze our moments? What if we could see our memories in the shape of patterns? In my story, you have a firefly inside your body. Experiencing each enjoyable memory, these fireflies  multiply and shine. As far as you add good memories, you shine more, and you become closer to the end of your way. That is when you are full of fireflies, and you actually become a firefly in your loved one's shining moments. Then, your journey will continue in their body and their memories' patterns.
