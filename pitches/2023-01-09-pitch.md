# Light Labyrinth
My project is about the journeys you go through to connect with the person you lost. You have a labyrinth bracelet with different light paths inside and some cards narrating your journey. You touch the bracelet to choose which way to go and the person you lost appears as a light to guide you. Each way has a special light pattern dedicated to special cards of stories leading you to only one ending point. There are two main worlds with two viewpoints: spiritual and existential.
