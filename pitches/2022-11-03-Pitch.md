# NO-TIME MOMENT

Based on the field research, I understood that you totally forget about the time when you experience emotional synchronization with someone. 

So, I came to the idea of a world with two characters who can stop time, make others disappear, and experience a new form of communication with each other.

This interaction can happen between two people who don't even know each other. They will consider each other and start communication when they have an accidental  synchronization. This is the beginning of the story.
