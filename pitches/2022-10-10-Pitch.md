# Our First Pitch:
The morai, being present, waiting to seep your tea, slow


What can happen if you consider the three minutes that you are waiting for your tea as a lifetime? How can we create more mindfulness for a couple of minutes and subconsciously understand that we are here to be at our truest potential? How can we comprehend that any distraction and carelessness is equal to less life? 
The QuickSlow is a storybook. The person will define the time they want to wait for their tea, and they can choose a story to follow. The person is in charge of defining the time of story, the starting point, and how many stages a story can have. If they choose many stages in a 3-minute story, then the story will be so fast. If they choose fewer stages, the story will be focused on each stage. The important thing about this is that the application uses sensors of distraction. With each distraction that the person has, the storyline becomes 5 seconds shorter. If the distraction reaches the limit, the character of the story will die.
