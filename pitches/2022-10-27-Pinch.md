Synchronization as a Way of Communication:

I observed the synchronization of humans, animals, and objects. Based on the interviews with individuals regarding their experiences with synchronization, I got to know that synchronization happens because of physical or emotional closeness, the tendency to line up, and being attracted to each other. It can also create deeper emotional interactions and help in sending messages.  Accordingly, my story is about the emotional synchronization between people, and how people can improvise synchronized emotions and develop telepathy or nostalgia for communication.
