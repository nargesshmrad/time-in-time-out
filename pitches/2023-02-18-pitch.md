# In my time of Loss
The story of synching with whom you lost
How do we synchronize emotionally with whom we lost?
We continue to live with them in our memories and we
will synch with them by thinking about them. My project
is about the journeys you go through to remember your
memories and connect with the person you lost. There are
4 stories with different endings. They all happen in a world
in which lost people appear in the shape of light. The labyrinth bracelet is a map of this world and shows where you
should go and where exactly you are in the story. You have
to conjure your loved one and they will guide you in your
journey. To see the light patterns, you have to touch your
bracelet. Each way has a special light pattern dedicated
to special cards of stories leading you to different ending
points.
