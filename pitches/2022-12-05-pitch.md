# Travel to Purgatory
We all find a way to connect with our dead loved ones. However, the danger of this connection is forgetting that you are alive. In my story, you go to the ghost world to find your friend. You have to listen to your intuition and focus on your memories to find the person. When you find them, you will realize that they can only live in the pattern of your memories as light and they can talk with you using poems.
